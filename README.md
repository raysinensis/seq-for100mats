command lines and scripts for converting between formats required by various RNA-seq software packages

Unfortuantely different RNA-seq software, from QC to steps in the analysis pipeline, often require different reference formats. The problem is further exacerbated by how different reference assemblies can differ in their column arrangements.

Collected here are simple command lines and scripts related to my own work for converting between the (way too many!) different formats. Reinventing the wheels a bit, perhaps.
